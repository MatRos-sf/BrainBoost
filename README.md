# Game instructions
## Results Keeper
### Game Start:
At the beginning, you’ll receive a math operation, e.g., 2 + 1. You must remember the result (3).

### Next Steps:
Then, a new operation will appear where the remembered number (not visible) will be used in the calculation, e.g., (remembered number) × 2.
Your task is to calculate the new result based on the previous one and provide the correct answer.

### Game End:
The game ends if you make 3 mistakes or 60 seconds pass.

### Difficulty Levels:

If you answer 10 consecutive calculations correctly in one session, the difficulty level will increase.
Higher levels mean larger numbers and more challenging math operations.

## Associative Changing
### How does the Associative Changing Method work?
Link each noun to a lively, dynamic image, adding action, emotion, colors, or motion.
For example:
* Horse – Imagine a galloping horse with a shining golden mane.
* Elephant – Visualize an elephant playing with colorful balloons.
* Eye – Picture a giant eye observing stars in the night sky.

Engage your senses! Feel the horse’s soft muzzle, hear the elephant’s trumpet, or see the sparkle in the eye.

### Game Rules
A list of nouns appears on the screen. Example: `Horse, Elephant, Eye`.

Your task is to memorize and type them in the correct order: `Horse, Elephant, Eye`.

If you forget a word, you can replace it with the symbol “-”. For example: `Horse, -, Eye`.

A perfect sequence gives you maximum points, while using “-” reduces your score.

### Difficulty Levels:

As you progress, the list of nouns will grow longer, requiring more creative associations.
Higher levels reward better scores but demand greater focus and imagination.
